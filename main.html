                        <p>Appropriately debuting in the Tales of Suspense issue titled “Iron Man is Born!,” the Mk. I armor was developed by Stark and fellow captive Ho Yinsen after Stark was kidnapped in Vietnam. (In the movie, Vietnam was updated to Afghanistan.) The suit was designed as a pacemaker to keep shrapnel from reaching Stark’s heart, and as in the movie, was used to escape his captors. Stark held onto the armor for a while in the comics, and painted it gold because its initial gray was too scary.</p>

                        <p>In the film, the Mk. II came about after Stark had returned to his swanky Malibu home and decided to revamp his original armor into the sleek design we all know, just shiny and chrome. The Mk. II was our first sight of the repulsor technology that would be in later iterations, and led to one of the best scenes in the original Iron Man. In the comics, the Mk. II was made after fighting Mister Doll, when Tony realized that the original armor was too cumbersome. One of the Mk. II models was later melted down to help create the Mk. 37.</p>

As we see in the movie, it’s the first complete version of the Iron Man armor, granted the red-and-gold color scheme and used to both defeat the Ten Rings terrorists and Obadiah Stane, aka the Iron Monger. This was the last armor in the comics that Stark wore before he got his first solo book.</p>

                        <p>In Iron Man 3, Tony Stark built an assortment of Iron Man suits — a little over 30 in total — as a coping method to distract himself from anxiety, an assemblage of technology known as the Iron Legion, but the Mk. 42 is the only one that really matters.</p>

                        <p>
                        Thanks to computer chips implanted into his arms, Stark can summon the various pieces of the Mk. 42 to his location at will, and even control it remotely like a drone. The armor in the comics has the same remote control ability, but was created in part thanks to Rocket Raccoon — who inspired the ability to add or detach mods for any situation.

The suit in Age of Ultron, meanwhile, is just a recolored version of his Mk. 42 from his last movie.</p>

The film version, meanwhile, marks the debut of the iconic Hulkbuster armor — which first showed up in the comics as Mk. 13 in Iron Man #300. The Hulkbuster armor got thoroughly messed up during the fight with Hulk in Age of Ultron, but was fixed up by the time of Avengers: Infinity War as the Mk. 49, worn by Bruce Banner.</p>

It was also the first armor to feature the new AI, FRIDAY, as JARVIS had been incorporated into the consciousness of the android Avenger, the Vision.</p>
